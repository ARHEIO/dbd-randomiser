This is Adam's Wiki

This is where I store the collective of information that I care about keeping.

It is sorted into:

- Contexts (specifics tips and tricks about technologies and libraries)
- Concepts (information that reaches across domains)
- Cookbooks (guides on how to do something from the ground up)
